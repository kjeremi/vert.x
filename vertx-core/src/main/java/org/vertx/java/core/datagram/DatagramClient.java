/**
 * A Datagram client which can be used to send {@link DatagramPacket}'s to remote Datagram servers.
 *
 * Usually you use a Datragram Client to send UDP over the wire. UDP is connection-less which means you are not connected
 * to the remote peer in a persistent way. Because of this you have to supply the address and port of the remote peer
 * when sending data.
 *
 * You can send data to ipv4 or ipv6 addresses, which also include multicast addresses.
